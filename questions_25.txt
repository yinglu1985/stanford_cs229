### **Question 1:**

You are a machine learning engineer working on a project that involves using both a gated dataset and a gated model from the Hugging Face Hub. The dataset and model require you to request access, and the authors have customized the access request forms to include additional fields such as your organization and intended use.

Once you have been granted access, you need to programmatically download the dataset and model using the appropriate libraries, ensuring secure authentication without exposing your credentials in your scripts.

Additionally, you need to create a private repository on the Hugging Face Hub to store your project files, which include large files over 5GB. You plan to collaborate with your team, so you want to set up the repository and authentication mechanisms accordingly.

Based on the best practices from the provided documents, which of the following is the correct approach to achieve all these tasks?

**A)**
- Request access to the gated dataset and model through the web interface, providing the additional requested information.
- Use `huggingface-cli login` to securely authenticate.
- Use the `datasets` and `transformers` libraries to download the dataset and model.
- Create a private repository, initialize Git LFS, and run `huggingface-cli lfs-enable-largefiles .` to handle large files.
- Have each team member create their own User Access Token with the `write` role and add their SSH keys to their accounts for collaboration.

**B)**
- Request access to the dataset and model via email to the authors.
- Include your username and password directly in your scripts to authenticate.
- Download the dataset and model files manually from the web interface.
- Create a public repository and commit large files directly without Git LFS.
- Share your User Access Token with team members for collaboration.

**C)**
- Access the gated dataset and model without requesting access since you have the direct links.
- Use anonymous access to download the resources.
- Create a private repository without initializing Git LFS, and upload large files via the web interface.
- Have team members use your credentials to push changes to the repository.

**D)**
- Request access to the dataset and model, but do not provide the additional requested information.
- Use a User Access Token with the `read` role embedded directly in your scripts.
- Clone the dataset and model repositories using Git.
- Create a public repository for your project.
- Team members contribute via pull requests without authentication.
