Document 83:  Two types of value-based methods [[two-types-value-based-methods]]

In value-based methods, **we learn a value function** that **maps a state to the expected value of being at that state.**

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/vbm-1.jpg" alt="Value Based Methods"/>

The value of a state is the **expected discounted return** the agent can get if it **starts at that state and then acts according to our policy.**

<Tip>
But what does it mean to act according to our policy? After all, we don't have a policy in value-based methods since we train a value function and not a policy.
</Tip>

Remember that the goal of an **RL agent is to have an optimal policy π\*.**

To find the optimal policy, we learned about two different methods:

- *Policy-based methods:* **Directly train the policy** to select what action to take given a state (or a probability distribution over actions at that state). In this case, we **don't have a value function.**

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/two-approaches-2.jpg" alt="Two RL approaches"/>

The policy takes a state as input and outputs what action to take at that state (deterministic policy: a policy that output one action given a state, contrary to stochastic policy that output a probability distribution over actions).

And consequently, **we don't define by hand the behavior of our policy; it's the training that will define it.**

- *Value-based methods:* **Indirectly, by training a value function** that outputs the value of a state or a state-action pair. Given this value function, our policy **will take an action.**

Since the policy is not trained/learned, **we need to specify its behavior.** For instance, if we want a policy that, given the value function, will take actions that always lead to the biggest reward, **we'll create a Greedy Policy.**

  <figcaption>Given a state, our action-value function (that we train) outputs the value of each action at that state. Then, our pre-defined Greedy Policy selects the action that will yield the highest value given a state or a state action pair.</figcaption>
</figure>

Consequently, whatever method you use to solve your problem, **you will have a policy**. In the case of value-based methods, you don't train the policy: your policy **is just a simple pre-specified function** (for instance, the Greedy Policy) that uses the values given by the value-function to select its actions.

So the difference is:

- In policy-based training, **the optimal policy (denoted π\*) is found by training the policy directly.**
- In value-based training, **finding an optimal value function (denoted Q\* or V\*, we'll study the difference below) leads to having an optimal policy.**

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/link-value-policy.jpg" alt="Link between value and policy"/>

In fact, most of the time, in value-based methods, you'll use **an Epsilon-Greedy Policy** that handles the exploration/exploitation trade-off; we'll talk about this when we talk about Q-Learning in the second part of this unit.


As we mentioned above, we have two types of value-based functions:

## The state-value function [[state-value-function]]

We write the state value function under a policy π like this:

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/state-value-function-1.jpg" alt="State value function"/>

For each state, the state-value function outputs the expected return if the agent **starts at that state** and then follows the policy forever afterward (for all future timesteps, if you prefer).

<figure>
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/state-value-function-2.jpg" alt="State value function"/>
  <figcaption>If we take the state with value -7: it's the expected return starting at that state and taking actions according to our policy (greedy policy), so right, right, right, down, down, right, right.</figcaption>
</figure>

## The action-value function [[action-value-function]]

In the action-value function, for each state and action pair, the action-value function **outputs the expected return** if the agent starts in that state, takes that action, and then follows the policy forever after.

The value of taking action \\(a\\) in state \\(s\\) under a policy \\(π\\) is:

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/action-state-value-function-1.jpg" alt="Action State value function"/>
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/action-state-value-function-2.jpg" alt="Action State value function"/>


We see that the difference is:

- For the state-value function, we calculate **the value of a state \\(S_t\\)**
- For the action-value function, we calculate **the value of the state-action pair ( \\(S_t, A_t\\) ) hence the value of taking that action at that state.**

<figure>
  <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/two-types.jpg" alt="Two types of value function"/>
  <figcaption>
Note: We didn't fill all the state-action pairs for the example of Action-value function</figcaption>
</figure>

In either case, whichever value function we choose (state-value or action-value function), **the returned value is the expected return.**

However, the problem is that **to calculate EACH value of a state or a state-action pair, we need to sum all the rewards an agent can get if it starts at that state.**

This can be a computationally expensive process, and that's **where the Bellman equation comes in to help us.**

### Translating the course into your language

As part of our mission to democratise machine learning, we'd love to have the course available in many more languages! Please follow the steps below if you'd like to help translate the course into your language 🙏.

**🗞️ Open an issue**

To get started, navigate to the [_Issues_](https://github.com/huggingface/course/issues) page of this repo and check if anyone else has opened an issue for your language. If not, open a new issue by selecting the _Translation template_ from the _New issue_ button.

Once an issue is created, post a comment to indicate which chapters you'd like to work on and we'll add your name to the list.

**🗣 Join our Discord**

Since it can be difficult to discuss translation details quickly over GitHub issues, we have created dedicated channels for each language on our Discord server. If you'd like to join, follow the instructions at this channel 👉: [https://discord.gg/JfAtkvEtRb](https://discord.gg/JfAtkvEtRb)

**🍴 Fork the repository**

Next, you'll need to [fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). You can do this by clicking on the **Fork** button on the top-right corner of this repo's page.

Once you've forked the repo, you'll want to get the files on your local machine for editing. You can do that by cloning the fork with Git as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/course
```

**📋 Copy-paste the English files with a new language code**

The course files are organised under a main directory:

* [`chapters`](https://github.com/huggingface/course/tree/main/chapters): all the text and code snippets associated with the course.

You'll only need to copy the files in the [`chapters/en`](https://github.com/huggingface/course/tree/main/chapters/en) directory, so first navigate to your fork of the repo and run the following:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/course
cp -r chapters/en/CHAPTER-NUMBER chapters/LANG-ID/CHAPTER-NUMBER
```

Here, `CHAPTER-NUMBER` refers to the chapter you'd like to work on and `LANG-ID` should be one of the ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 language codes -- see [here](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) for a handy table.

**✍️ Start translating**

Now comes the fun part - translating the text! The first thing we recommend is translating the part of the `_toctree.yml` file that corresponds to your chapter. This file is used to render the table of contents on the website and provide the links to the Colab notebooks. The only fields you should change are the `title`, ones -- for example, here are the parts of `_toctree.yml` that we'd translate for [Chapter 0](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/1?fw=pt):

```yaml
- title: 0. Setup # Translate this!
  sections:
  - local: chapter0/1 # Do not change this!
    title: Introduction # Translate this!
```

> 🚨 Make sure the `_toctree.yml` file only contains the sections that have been translated! Otherwise you won't be able to build the content on the website or locally (see below how).


Once you have translated the `_toctree.yml` file, you can start translating the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files associated with your chapter.

> 🙋 If the `_toctree.yml` file doesn't yet exist for your language, you can simply create one by copy-pasting from the English version and deleting the sections that aren't related to your chapter. Just make sure it exists in the `chapters/LANG-ID/` directory!

**👷‍♂️ Build the course locally**

Once you're happy with your changes, you can preview how they'll look by first installing the [`doc-builder`](https://github.com/huggingface/doc-builder) tool that we use for building all documentation at Hugging Face:

```
pip install hf-doc-builder
```

```
doc-builder preview course ../course/chapters/LANG-ID --not_python_module
```

**`preview` command does not work with Windows.

This will build and render the course on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Although the content looks much nicer on the Hugging Face website, this step will still allow you to check that everything is formatted correctly.

**🚀 Submit a pull request**

If the translations look good locally, the final step is to prepare the content for a pull request. Here, the first think to check is that the files are formatted correctly. For that you can run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
make style
```

Once that's run, commit any changes, open a pull request, and tag [@lewtun](https://github.com/lewtun) for a review. Congratulations, you've now completed your first translation 🥳!

> 🚨 To build the course on the website, double-check your language code exists in `languages` field of the `build_documentation.yml` and `build_pr_documentation.yml` files in the `.github` folder. If not, just add them in their alphabetical order.

## 📔 Jupyter notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks containing all the code from the course are hosted on the [`huggingface/notebooks`](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks) repo. If you wish to generate them locally, first install the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the following script:

```bash
python utils/generate_notebooks.py --output_dir nbs
```

This script extracts all the code snippets from the chapters and stores them as notebooks in the `nbs` folder (which is ignored by Git by default).

## ✍️ Contributing a new chapter

> Note: we are not currently accepting community contributions for new chapters. These instructions are for the Hugging Face authors.

Adding a new chapter to the course is quite simple:

1. Create a new directory under `chapters/en/chapterX`, where `chapterX` is the chapter you'd like to add.
2. Add numbered MDX files `sectionX.mdx` for each section. If you need to include images, place them in the [huggingface-course/documentation-images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images) repository and use the [HTML Images Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp) with the path `https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/{langY}/{chapterX}/{your-image.png}`.
3. Update the `_toctree.yml` file to include your chapter sections -- this information will render the table of contents on the website. If your section involves both the PyTorch and TensorFlow APIs of `transformers`, make sure you include links to both Colabs in the `colab` field.

If you get stuck, check out one of the existing chapters -- this will often show you the expected syntax.

Once you are happy with the content, open a pull request and tag [@lewtun](https://github.com/lewtun) for a review. We recommend adding the first chapter draft as a single pull request -- the team will then provide feedback internally to iterate on the content 🤗!

## setup

This folder is managed as 'monorepo' a multi-package repository which make dependency management very simple. In order to do this we use `pnpm` as our package manager.

Make sure [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) is installed by [following the installation instructions for your system](https://pnpm.io/installation).

You will also need `node` which you probably already have

## running the application

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

This will install the dependencies for all packages and link any local packages

## local development

To develop locally, open two terminal tabs from the root of the repository.

Run the python test server, from the root directory:

```bash
cd demo/kitchen_sink
python run.py
```

This will start a development server on port `7860` that the web app is expecting.

Run the web app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## building for production

Run the build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will create the necessary files in `js/app/public` and also in `gradio/templates/frontend`.

## quality checks

The repos currently has two quality checks that can be run locally and are run in CI.

### formatting

Formatting is handled by [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) to ensure consistent formatting and prevent style-focused conversations. Formatting failures will fails CI and should be reoslve before merging.

To check formatting:

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

If you have formatting failures then you can run the following command to fix them:

```bash
pnpm format:write
```

### type checking

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to provide static types to javascript code. These checks are also run in CI.

to typecheck the code:

```bash
pnpm ts:check
```

## ci checks

Currently the following checks are run in CI:

### static checks

- Format check (`pnpm format:check`)
- Build css (`pnpm css`)
- Build client (`pnpm build`)
- Type check (`pnpm ts:check`)
- Unit tests (`pnpm test:run`)

### functional test

```
pip install -r demo/outbreak_forecast/requirements.txt
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm exec playwright install-deps chromium

# Retrieval Augmented Generation with Huggingface Transformers and Ray


##### A guest blog post by <a href="/amogkam">Amog Kamsetty</a> from the Anyscale team

[Huggingface Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) recently added the [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://twitter.com/huggingface/status/1310597560906780680) model, a new NLP architecture that leverages external documents (like Wikipedia) to augment its knowledge and achieve state of the art results on knowledge-intensive tasks. In this blog post, we introduce the integration of [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/), a library for building scalable applications, into the RAG contextual document retrieval mechanism. This speeds up retrieval calls by 2x and improves the scalability of RAG distributed [fine-tuning](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/research_projects/rag).



### What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?
![alt_text](assets/12_ray_rag/rag_gif.gif "image_tooltip")

_An overview of RAG. The model retrieves contextual documents from an external dataset as part of its execution. These contextual documents are used in conjunction with the original input to produce an output. The  GIF is taken from [Facebook's original blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models)._



Recently, [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) partnered with [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) to introduce the [RAG](https://twitter.com/huggingface/status/1310597560906780680) model as part of its Transformers library. 


[RAG](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/) acts just like any other [seq2seq model](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html). However, [RAG](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/) has an intermediate component that retrieves contextual documents from an external knowledge base (like a Wikipedia text corpus). These documents are then used in conjunction with the input sequence and passed into the underlying seq2seq [generator](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).


This information retrieval step allows [RAG](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/) to make use of multiple sources of knowledge -- those that are baked into the model parameters and the information that is contained in the contextual passages, allowing it to outperform other state-of-the-art models in tasks like question answering. You can try it for yourself using this [demo provided by Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/rag/)!


### Scaling up fine-tuning
This retrieval of contextual documents is crucial for RAG's state-of-the-art results but introduces an extra layer of complexity. When scaling up the training process via a data-parallel training routine, a naive implementation of the document lookup can become a bottleneck for training. Further, the **document index** used in the retrieval component is often quite large, making it infeasible for each training worker to load its own replicated copy of the index.

The previous implementation of RAG fine-tuning leveraged the [torch.distributed](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) communication package for the  document retrieval portion. However, this implementation sometimes proved to be inflexible and limited in scalability.

Instead, a framework-agnostic and a more flexible implementation for ad-hoc concurrent programming is required. [Ray](https://ray.io/) fits the bill perfectly. Ray is a simple, yet powerful Python library for general-purpose distributed and parallel programming. Using Ray for distributed document retrieval, we achieved a **2x speedup per retrieval call compared to `torch.distributed`**, and overall better fine-tuning scalability.

### Ray for Document Retrieval
![alt_text](assets/12_ray_rag/torch_distributed_document_retrieval.png "image_tooltip")
_Document retrieval with the torch.distributed implementation_


The main drawback of the [torch.distributed](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) implementation for document retrieval was that it latched onto the same process group used for training and only the rank 0 training worker loaded the index into memory.

As a result, this implementation had some limitations:

1. **Synchronization bottleneck**: The rank 0 worker had to receive the inputs from all workers, perform the index query, and then send the results back to the other workers. This limited performance with multiple training workers.
2. **PyTorch specific**: The document retrieval process group had to latch onto the existing process group used for training, meaning that PyTorch had to be used for training as well.

![alt_text](assets/12_ray_rag/ray_arch_updated.png "image_tooltip")
_Document retrieval with the Ray implementation_

To overcome these limitations, we introduced a novel implementation of distributed retrieval based on Ray. With [Ray’s stateful actor abstractions](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/actors.html), multiple processes that are separate from the training processes are used to load the index and handle the retrieval queries. With multiple Ray actors, retrieval is no longer a bottleneck and PyTorch is no longer a requirement for RAG.

And as you can see below, using the [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/) based implementation leads to better retrieval performance for multi-GPU fine-tuning. The following results show the seconds per retrieval call and we can see that as we increase the number of GPUs that we train on, using Ray has comparatively better performance than `torch.distributed`. Also, if we increase the number of Ray processes that perform retrieval, we also get better performance with more training workers since a single retrieval process is no longer a bottleneck.


<table>

   <td>
   </td>
   <td>2 GPU
   </td>
   <td>3 GPU
   </td>
   <td>4 GPU
   </td>
  </tr>

   <td>torch.distributed
   </td>

   <td>Ray 2 retrieval processes

   <td>1.49 sec/retrieve

   </td>
   <td>1.484 sec/retrieve
   </td>
   <td>1.66 sec/retrieve
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


_A performance comparison of different retrieval implementations. For each document retrieval implementation, we run 500 training steps with a per-GPU batch size of 8, and measure the time it takes to retrieve the contextual documents for each batch on the rank 0 training worker. As the results show, using multiple retrieval processes improves performance, especially as we scale training to multiple GPUs._


### How do I use it?

[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) provides a [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) based [fine tuning script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/research_projects/rag), and we extended it to add the Ray retrieval implementation as an option. 

To try it out, first install the necessary requirements


```bash
pip install ray
pip install transformers
pip install -r transformers/examples/research_projects/rag/requirements.txt
```


Then, you can specify your data paths and other configurations and run [finetune-rag-ray.sh](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/research_projects/rag/finetune_rag_ray.sh)!


```bash
# Sample script to finetune RAG using Ray for distributed retrieval.

# Add parent directory to python path to access lightning_base.py
export PYTHONPATH="../":"${PYTHONPATH}"

# Start a single-node Ray cluster.
ray start --head

# A sample finetuning run, you need to specify data_dir, output_dir and model_name_or_path
# run ./examples/rag/finetune_rag_ray.sh --help to see all the possible options

## What’s next?

Using RAG with [Huggingface transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/research_projects/rag) and the [Ray retrieval implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/research_projects/rag/finetune_rag_ray.sh) for faster distributed fine-tuning, you can leverage RAG for retrieval-based generation on your own knowledge-intensive tasks.


Also, hyperparameter tuning is another aspect of transformer fine tuning and can have [huge impacts on accuracy](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/hyperparameter-optimization-for-transformers-a-guide-c4e32c6c989b). For scalable and easy hyperparameter tuning, check out the [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/) library. By using [Ray Tune’s integration with PyTorch Lightning](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/scaling-up-pytorch-lightning-hyperparameter-tuning-with-ray-tune-4bd9e1ff9929), or the [built-in integration with Huggingface transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/ray-tune), you can run experiments to find the perfect hyperparameters for your RAG model.

And lastly, stay tuned for a potential Tensorflow implementation of [RAG](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models) on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)!

If you plan to try RAG+Ray integration out, please feel free to share your experiences on the [Ray Discourse](https://discuss.ray.io/) or join the [Ray community Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAcoiLCHOguOm8e7Jnn-JJdZaCxPGjgVCvFijHB5PLaQLeig/viewform) for further discussion -- we’d love to hear from you!

## Context

The Hugging Face Hub hosts hundreds of thousands of public models and datasets. Public doesn't necessarily mean open-source without any limitations. Authors can define which license applies to the work they share (e.g. [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), [Apache2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), [OpenRAIL](https://huggingface.co/blog/open_rail), etc.). All users must be able to quickly know which license applies to which model and even to list models with a specific license (e.g. [Apache2.0](https://huggingface.co/models?license=license:apache-2.0&sort=trending)). The Hub relies on the [Model Card](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards) to do so. A Model Card is a file attached to a model providing handy information. They are essential for discoverability, reproducibility and sharing. In our case, we will focus on the [metadata](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards#model-card-metadata) section of the Model Card. This metadata contains valuable information, including a `license` tag.

In this challenge, we will focus on models that have the license `"other"`. This means that the model has a custom license defined by the author. For example, models from Coqui have their own [coqui-public-model-license](https://coqui.ai/cpml). Historically, this information was not available in the model card metadata. This is now possible by adding the license name and a URL to it:


```yaml
# Example from https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v1
---
license: other
license_name: coqui-public-model-license
license_link: https://coqui.ai/cpml
---
```

which display on the Hub as

![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/license_other_example.png)


This challenge aims to improve the completeness of this metadata on the Hub, which will ultimately benefit all users.

In other cases, the license was previously set as `other` but given the popularity of the models, the Hugging Face Hub started to support the license officially. This is especially the case of Llama 2 models for which the `license:llama2` is now a supported license. In this case, it's best to set it directly in the Model Card metadata:

```yaml
# Example from https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-34b-hf
---
license: llama2
---
```

## How to contribute?

How to do it in practice? That's simple! We have listed models below that have `license:other` in their metadata and contain a LICENSE file in the repo. Those models require an update in their metadata to describe which license is attached.

For each model, the workflow looks like this:
1. Choose a model in the list below. We suggest focusing on the most downloaded or liked models first.
2. **Check that the model doesn't already have a PR to update the license**. Maybe another contributor already checked it!
3. Find the corresponding license. URLs to the LICENSE file(s) in the repo is provided to ease the search.
   1. Note: the table suggests the name/URL for Llama models. It doesn't mean that the suggestion is accurate. It is to be double-checked correctly.
4. Check which license applies to the model. Attributes are:
   1. `license_name` (short, lowercase, without spaces). Example: `"coqui-public-model-license"`
   2. `license_link`. If possible, a URL owned by the author is better (for example: `"https://coqui.ai/cpml"`). Otherwise, linking to the LICENSE file in the repo is also fine.
   3. **NOTE:** special case if it's a Llama 2 model. In this case, the card metadata should be `license: llama2` instead of `license: other` and `license_name`/`license_link` are not needed.
5. Open a PR on the Hub, describing the intent and suggesting a modification to the repo author. Here are 2 example for [XTTS-v1](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v1/discussions/10/files) and [stable-diffusion-xl-base-0.9](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-0.9/discussions/58) models.
6. Once done, open a PR on GitHub to update the table below. Once merged, this will count as a Hacktoberfest contribution! In the PR, add the `pr_url` (the one on the Hub) and a status (opened, merged, closed).

## F.A.Q.

### What if the model has 2 licenses?

This use case can happen when a model is finetuned from another model. Usually this is manually described in the model card. As we don't have a good way to classify multi-license models, it's best to simply keep `license:other`. If that's the case, you can open a PR to add a "multi-license" status to the table below.

### How do I choose `license_name`?

There is no clear answer for that. You can either check other related models, discuss with the repo owner or suggest a name that make sense in your opinion. The name should be short, lowercase and without spaces (for example `"coqui-public-model-license"`).

### Can I use a script to automate the process?

Yes, it's perfectly possible to use a script to automate things! But don't forget that in the end, only **some of the process** can be automated. The PRs you open will be manually reviewed. It's important to refrain from polluting the repo owners with unchecked information.

To help with the programmatic approach, we've also exported the list [as CSV](./model_license_other.csv). This CSV will not be updated with the latest information on this page.

## Model list

Here is the list of models with `license:other` and a LICENSE file in the repo.

# Unit 8 Part 2: Advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning. Using Sample Factory to play Doom from pixels

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit9/thumbnail2.png" alt="Thumbnail"/>

In this notebook, we will learn how to train a Deep Neural Network to collect objects in a 3D environment based on the game of Doom, a video of the resulting policy is shown below. We train this policy using [Sample Factory](https://www.samplefactory.dev/), an asynchronous implementation of the PPO algorithm.

Please note the following points:

*   [Sample Factory](https://www.samplefactory.dev/) is an advanced RL framework and **only functions on Linux and Mac** (not Windows).

*  The framework performs best on a **GPU machine with many CPU cores**, where it can achieve speeds of 100k interactions per second. The resources available on a standard Colab notebook **limit the performance of this library**. So the speed in this setting **does not reflect the real-world performance**.
* Benchmarks for Sample Factory are available in a number of settings, check out the [examples](https://github.com/alex-petrenko/sample-factory/tree/master/sf_examples) if you want to find out more.


```python
from IPython.display import HTML

HTML(
    """<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="https://huggingface.co/edbeeching/doom_health_gathering_supreme_3333/resolve/main/replay.mp4"
  type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>"""
)
```

To validate this hands-on for the [certification process](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction#certification-process), you need to push one model:

- `doom_health_gathering_supreme` get a result of >= 5.

To find your result, go to the [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard) and find your model, **the result = mean_reward - std of reward**

If you don't find your model, **go to the bottom of the page and click on the refresh button**

For more information about the certification process, check this section 👉 https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction#certification-process

## Set the GPU 💪

- To **accelerate the agent's training, we'll use a GPU**. To do that, go to `Runtime > Change Runtime type`

- `Hardware Accelerator > GPU`

Before starting to train our agent, let's **study the library and environments we're going to use**.

## Sample Factory

[Sample Factory](https://www.samplefactory.dev/) is one of the **fastest RL libraries focused on very efficient synchronous and asynchronous implementations of policy gradients (PPO)**.

Sample Factory is thoroughly **tested, used by many researchers and practitioners**, and is actively maintained. Our implementation is known to **reach SOTA performance in a variety of domains while minimizing RL experiment training time and hardware requirements**.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit9/samplefactoryenvs.png" alt="Sample factory"/>

- [Multiple](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/mujoco/) [example](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/atari/) [environment](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/vizdoom/) [integrations](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/dmlab/) with tuned parameters and trained models

All of the above policies are available on the 🤗 hub. Search for the tag [sample-factory](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sample-factory&sort=downloads)

### How sample-factory works

Sample-factory is one of the **most highly optimized RL implementations available to the community**.

It works by **spawning multiple processes that run rollout workers, inference workers and a learner worker**.

The *workers* **communicate through shared memory, which lowers the communication cost between processes**.

The *rollout workers* interact with the environment and send observations to the *inference workers*.

The *inferences workers* query a fixed version of the policy and **send actions back to the rollout worker**.

After *k* steps the rollout works send a trajectory of experience to the learner worker, **which it uses to update the agent’s policy network**.

### Actor Critic models in Sample-factory

Actor Critic models in Sample Factory are composed of three components:

- **Encoder** - Process input observations (images, vectors) and map them to a vector. This is the part of the model you will most likely want to customize.
- **Core** - Intergrate vectors from one or more encoders, can optionally include a single- or multi-layer LSTM/GRU in a memory-based agent.
- **Decoder** - Apply additional layers to the output of the model core before computing the policy and value outputs.

The library has been designed to automatically support any observation and action spaces. Users can easily add their custom models. You can find out more in the [documentation](https://www.samplefactory.dev/03-customization/custom-models/#actor-critic-models-in-sample-factory).

## ViZDoom

[ViZDoom](https://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/) is an **open-source python interface for the Doom Engine**.

The library was created in 2016 by Marek Wydmuch, Michal Kempka  at the Institute of Computing Science, Poznan University of Technology, Poland.

The library enables the **training of agents directly from the screen pixels in a number of scenarios**, including team deathmatch, shown in the video below. Because the ViZDoom environment is based on a game the was created in the 90s, it can be run on modern hardware at accelerated speeds, **allowing us to learn complex AI behaviors fairly quickly**.

The library includes feature such as:

- Multi-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows),
- API for Python and C++,
- [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) environment wrappers
- Easy-to-create custom scenarios (visual editors, scripting language, and examples available),
- Async and sync single-player and multiplayer modes,
- Lightweight (few MBs) and fast (up to 7000 fps in sync mode, single-threaded),
- Customizable resolution and rendering parameters,
- Access to the depth buffer (3D vision),
- Automatic labeling of game objects visible in the frame,
- Access to the audio buffer
- Access to the list of actors/objects and map geometry,
- Off-screen rendering and episode recording,
- Time scaling in async mode.

## We first need to install some dependencies that are required for the ViZDoom environment

Now that our Colab runtime is set up, we can start by installing the dependencies required to run ViZDoom on linux.

If you are following on your machine on Mac, you will want to follow the installation instructions on the [github page](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/blob/master/doc/Quickstart.md#-quickstart-for-macos-and-anaconda3-python-36).

```python
# Install ViZDoom deps from
# https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom/blob/master/doc/Building.md#-linux

apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev libsdl2-dev libjpeg-dev \
nasm tar libbz2-dev libgtk2.0-dev cmake git libfluidsynth-dev libgme-dev \
libopenal-dev timidity libwildmidi-dev unzip ffmpeg

# Boost libraries
apt-get install libboost-all-dev

# Lua binding dependencies
apt-get install liblua5.1-dev
```

## Then we can install Sample Factory and ViZDoom

- This can take 7min

```bash
pip install sample-factory
pip install vizdoom
```

def parse_vizdoom_cfg(argv=None, evaluation=False):
    parser, _ = parse_sf_args(argv=argv, evaluation=evaluation)
    # parameters specific to Doom envs
    add_doom_env_args(parser)
    # override Doom default values for algo parameters
    doom_override_defaults(parser)
    # second parsing pass yields the final configuration
    final_cfg = parse_full_cfg(parser, argv)
    return final_cfg
```

Now that the setup if complete, we can train the agent. We have chosen here to learn a ViZDoom task called `Health Gathering Supreme`.

### The scenario: Health Gathering Supreme

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit9/Health-Gathering-Supreme.png" alt="Health-Gathering-Supreme"/>



The objective of this scenario is to **teach the agent how to survive without knowing what makes it survive**. The Agent know only that **life is precious** and death is bad so **it must learn what prolongs its existence and that its health is connected with survival**.

The map is a rectangle containing walls and with a green, acidic floor which **hurts the player periodically**. Initially there are some medkits spread uniformly over the map. A new medkit falls from the skies every now and then. **Medkits heal some portions of player's health** - to survive, the agent needs to pick them up. The episode finishes after the player's death or on timeout.

Further configuration:
- Living_reward = 1
- 3 available buttons: turn left, turn right, move forward
- 1 available game variable: HEALTH
- death penalty = 100

You can find out more about the scenarios available in ViZDoom [here](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/tree/master/scenarios).

There are also a number of more complex scenarios that have been create for ViZDoom, such as the ones detailed on [this github page](https://github.com/edbeeching/3d_control_deep_rl).



## Training the agent

- We're going to train the agent for 4000000 steps. It will take approximately 20min

```python
## Start the training, this should take around 15 minutes
register_vizdoom_components()

# The scenario we train on today is health gathering
# other scenarios include "doom_basic", "doom_two_colors_easy", "doom_dm", "doom_dwango5", "doom_my_way_home", "doom_deadly_corridor", "doom_defend_the_center", "doom_defend_the_line"
env = "doom_health_gathering_supreme"
cfg = parse_vizdoom_cfg(
    argv=[f"--env={env}", "--num_workers=8", "--num_envs_per_worker=4", "--train_for_env_steps=4000000"]
)

status = run_rl(cfg)
```

## Let's take a look at the performance of the trained policy and output a video of the agent.

```python
from sample_factory.enjoy import enjoy

cfg = parse_vizdoom_cfg(
    argv=[f"--env={env}", "--num_workers=1", "--save_video", "--no_render", "--max_num_episodes=10"], evaluation=True
)
status = enjoy(cfg)
```

## Now lets visualize the performance of the agent

```python
from base64 import b64encode
from IPython.display import HTML

mp4 = open("/content/train_dir/default_experiment/replay.mp4", "rb").read()
data_url = "data:video/mp4;base64," + b64encode(mp4).decode()
HTML(
    """
<video width=640 controls>
      <source src="%s" type="video/mp4">
</video>
"""
    % data_url
)
```

The agent has learned something, but its performance could be better. We would clearly need to train for longer. But let's upload this model to the Hub.

## Now lets upload your checkpoint and video to the Hugging Face Hub




To be able to share your model with the community there are three more steps to follow:

1️⃣ (If it's not already done) create an account to HF ➡ https://huggingface.co/join

2️⃣ Sign in and get your authentication token from the Hugging Face website.
- Create a new token (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) **with write role**

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/notebooks/create-token.jpg" alt="Create HF Token">

- Copy the token
- Run the cell below and paste the token

If you don't want to use Google Colab or a Jupyter Notebook, you need to use this command instead: `huggingface-cli login`

```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login
notebook_login()
!git config --global credential.helper store
```

```python
from sample_factory.enjoy import enjoy

hf_username = "ThomasSimonini"  # insert your HuggingFace username here

cfg = parse_vizdoom_cfg(
    argv=[
        f"--env={env}",
        "--num_workers=1",
        "--save_video",
        "--no_render",
        "--max_num_episodes=10",
        "--max_num_frames=100000",
        "--push_to_hub",
        f"--hf_repository={hf_username}/rl_course_vizdoom_health_gathering_supreme",
    ],
    evaluation=True,
)
status = enjoy(cfg)
```

## Let's load another model




This agent's performance was good, but we can do better! Let's download and visualize an agent trained for 10B timesteps from the hub.

```bash
#download the agent from the hub
python -m sample_factory.huggingface.load_from_hub -r edbeeching/doom_health_gathering_supreme_2222 -d ./train_dir
```

```bash
ls train_dir/doom_health_gathering_supreme_2222
```

```python
env = "doom_health_gathering_supreme"
cfg = parse_vizdoom_cfg(
    argv=[
        f"--env={env}",
        "--num_workers=1",
        "--save_video",
        "--no_render",
        "--max_num_episodes=10",
        "--experiment=doom_health_gathering_supreme_2222",
        "--train_dir=train_dir",
    ],
    evaluation=True,
)
status = enjoy(cfg)
```

```python
mp4 = open("/content/train_dir/doom_health_gathering_supreme_2222/replay.mp4", "rb").read()
data_url = "data:video/mp4;base64," + b64encode(mp4).decode()
HTML(
    """
<video width=640 controls>
      <source src="%s" type="video/mp4">
</video>
"""
    % data_url
)
```

## Some additional challenges 🏆: Doom Deathmatch

Training an agent to play a Doom deathmatch **takes many hours on a more beefy machine than is available in Colab**.

Fortunately, we have have **already trained an agent in this scenario and it is available in the 🤗 Hub!** Let’s download the model and visualize the agent’s performance.

```python
# Download the agent from the hub
python -m sample_factory.huggingface.load_from_hub -r edbeeching/doom_deathmatch_bots_2222 -d ./train_dir
```

Given the agent plays for a long time the video generation can take **10 minutes**.

```python
from sample_factory.enjoy import enjoy

register_vizdoom_components()
env = "doom_deathmatch_bots"
cfg = parse_vizdoom_cfg(
    argv=[
        f"--env={env}",
        "--num_workers=1",
        "--save_video",
        "--no_render",
        "--max_num_episodes=1",
        "--experiment=doom_deathmatch_bots_2222",
        "--train_dir=train_dir",
    ],
    evaluation=True,
)
status = enjoy(cfg)
mp4 = open("/content/train_dir/doom_deathmatch_bots_2222/replay.mp4", "rb").read()
data_url = "data:video/mp4;base64," + b64encode(mp4).decode()
HTML(
    """
<video width=640 controls>
      <source src="%s" type="video/mp4">
</video>
"""
    % data_url
)
```


You **can try to train your agent in this environment** using the code above, but not on colab.
**Good luck 🤞**

If you prefer an easier scenario, **why not try training in another ViZDoom scenario such as `doom_deadly_corridor` or `doom_defend_the_center`.**

⚠️ A **new updated version of this article is available here** 👉 [https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit1/introduction](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit2/q-learning)

*This article is part of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Class. A free course from beginner to expert. Check the syllabus [here.](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction)*

[In the first part of this unit](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-q-part1), **we learned about the value-based methods and the difference between Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference Learning**.

So, in the second part, we’ll **study Q-Learning**, **and implement our first RL agent from scratch**, a Q-Learning agent, and will train it in two environments:

1. Frozen Lake v1 ❄️: where our agent will need to **go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G)** by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoiding holes (H).
2. An autonomous taxi 🚕: where the agent will need **to learn to navigate** a city to **transport its passengers from point A to point B.**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/envs.gif" alt="Environments"/>
</figure>

This unit is fundamental if you want to be able to work on Deep Q-Learning (Unit 3).

So let’s get started! 🚀

- [Introducing Q-Learning](#introducing-q-learning)
  - [What is Q-Learning?](#what-is-q-learning)
  - [The Q-Learning algorithm](#the-q-learning-algorithm)
  - [Off-policy vs. On-policy](#off-policy-vs-on-policy)
- [A Q-Learning example](#a-q-learning-example)



## **Introducing Q-Learning**
### **What is Q-Learning?**

Q-Learning is an **off-policy value-based method that uses a TD approach to train its action-value function:**

- *Off-policy*: we'll talk about that at the end of this chapter.
- *Value-based method*: finds the optimal policy indirectly by training a value or action-value function that will tell us **the value of each state or each state-action pair.**
- *Uses a TD approach:* **updates its action-value function at each step instead of at the end of the episode.**

**Q-Learning is the algorithm we use to train our Q-Function**, an **action-value function** that determines the value of being at a particular state and taking a specific action at that state.

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-function.jpg" alt="Q-function"/>
  <figcaption>Given a state and action, our Q Function outputs a state-action value (also called Q-value)</figcaption>
</figure>

The **Q comes from "the Quality" of that action at that state.**

Internally, our Q-function has **a Q-table, a table where each cell corresponds to a state-action value pair value.** Think of this Q-table as **the memory or cheat sheet of our Q-function.**

If we take this maze example:

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Maze-1.jpg" alt="Maze example"/>
</figure>

The Q-Table is initialized. That's why all values are = 0. This table **contains, for each state, the four state-action values.**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Maze-2.jpg" alt="Maze example"/>
</figure>

Here we see that the **state-action value of the initial state and going up is 0:**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Maze-3.jpg" alt="Maze example"/>
</figure>

Therefore, Q-function contains a Q-table **that has the value of each-state action pair.** And given a state and action, **our Q-Function will search inside its Q-table to output the value.**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-function-2.jpg" alt="Q-function"/>
  <figcaption>Given a state and action pair, our Q-function will search inside its Q-table to output the state-action pair value (the Q value).</figcaption>
</figure>

If we recap, *Q-Learning* **is the RL algorithm that:**

- Trains *Q-Function* (an **action-value function**) which internally is a *Q-table* **that contains all the state-action pair values.**
- Given a state and action, our Q-Function **will search into its Q-table the corresponding value.**
- When the training is done, **we have an optimal Q-function, which means we have optimal Q-Table.**
- And if we **have an optimal Q-function**, we **have an optimal policy** since we **know for each state what is the best action to take.**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/link-value-policy.jpg" alt="Link value policy"/>
</figure>

But, in the beginning, **our Q-Table is useless since it gives arbitrary values for each state-action pair** (most of the time, we initialize the Q-Table to 0 values). But, as we'll **explore the environment and update our Q-Table, it will give us better and better approximations.**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-learning-1.jpg" alt="Q-learning"/>
  <figcaption>We see here that with the training, our Q-Table is better since, thanks to it, we can know the value of each state-action pair.</figcaption>
</figure>

So now that we understand what Q-Learning, Q-Function, and Q-Table are, **let's dive deeper into the Q-Learning algorithm**.

### **The Q-Learning algorithm**

This is the Q-Learning pseudocode; let's study each part and **see how it works with a simple example before implementing it.** Don't be intimidated by it, it's simpler than it looks! We'll go over each step.

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-learning-2.jpg" alt="Q-learning"/>
</figure>

**Step 1: We initialize the Q-Table**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-learning-3.jpg" alt="Q-learning"/>
</figure>

We need to initialize the Q-Table for each state-action pair. **Most of the time, we initialize with values of 0.**

**Step 2: Choose action using Epsilon Greedy Strategy**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-learning-4.jpg" alt="Q-learning"/>
</figure>

Epsilon Greedy Strategy is a policy that handles the exploration/exploitation trade-off.

The idea is that we define epsilon ɛ = 1.0:

- *With probability 1 — ɛ* : we do **exploitation** (aka our agent selects the action with the highest state-action pair value).
- With probability ɛ: **we do exploration** (trying random action).

At the beginning of the training, **the probability of doing exploration will be huge since ɛ is very high, so most of the time, we'll explore.** But as the training goes on, and consequently our **Q-Table gets better and better in its estimations, we progressively reduce the epsilon value** since we will need less and less exploration and more exploitation.

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-learning-5.jpg" alt="Q-learning"/>
</figure>

**Step 3: Perform action At, gets reward Rt+1 and next state St+1**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-learning-6.jpg" alt="Q-learning"/>
</figure>

**Step 4: Update Q(St, At)**

Remember that in TD Learning, we update our policy or value function (depending on the RL method we choose) **after one step of the interaction.**

To produce our TD target, **we used the immediate reward \\(R_{t+1}\\) plus the discounted value of the next state best state-action pair** (we call that bootstrap).

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-learning-7.jpg" alt="Q-learning"/>
</figure>

Therefore, our \\(Q(S_t, A_t)\\) **update formula goes like this:**

  <figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-learning-8.jpg" alt="Q-learning"/>
</figure>

It means that to update our \\(Q(S_t, A_t)\\):

- We need \\(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}\\).
- To update our Q-value at a given state-action pair, we use the TD target.

How do we form the TD target? 
1. We obtain the reward after taking the action \\(R_{t+1}\\).
2. To get the **best next-state-action pair value**, we use a greedy policy to select the next best action. Note that this is not an epsilon greedy policy, this will always take the action with the highest state-action value.

Then when the update of this Q-value is done. We start in a new_state and select our action **using our epsilon-greedy policy again.**

**It's why we say that this is an off-policy algorithm.**

### **Off-policy vs On-policy**

The difference is subtle:

- *Off-policy*: using **a different policy for acting and updating.**

For instance, with Q-Learning, the Epsilon greedy policy (acting policy), is different from the greedy policy that is **used to select the best next-state action value to update our Q-value (updating policy).**


<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/off-on-1.jpg" alt="Off-on policy"/>
  <figcaption>Acting Policy</figcaption>
</figure>

Is different from the policy we use during the training part:


<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/off-on-2.jpg" alt="Off-on policy"/>
  <figcaption>Updating policy</figcaption>
</figure>

- *On-policy:* using the **same policy for acting and updating.**

For instance, with Sarsa, another value-based algorithm, **the Epsilon-Greedy Policy selects the next_state-action pair, not a greedy policy.**


<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/off-on-3.jpg" alt="Off-on policy"/>
    <figcaption>Sarsa</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/off-on-4.jpg" alt="Off-on policy"/>
</figure>

## **A Q-Learning example**

To better understand Q-Learning, let's take a simple example:

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Maze-Example-2.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>

- You're a mouse in this tiny maze. You always **start at the same starting point.**
- The goal is **to eat the big pile of cheese at the bottom right-hand corner** and avoid the poison. After all, who doesn't like cheese?
- The episode ends if we eat the poison, **eat the big pile of cheese or if we spent more than five steps.**
- The learning rate is 0.1
- The gamma (discount rate) is 0.99

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/q-ex-1.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>
The reward function goes like this:

- **+0:** Going to a state with no cheese in it.
- **+1:** Going to a state with a small cheese in it.
- **+10:** Going to the state with the big pile of cheese.
- **-10:** Going to the state with the poison and thus die.
- **+0** If we spend more than five steps.

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/q-ex-2.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>
  
To train our agent to have an optimal policy (so a policy that goes right, right, down), **we will use the Q-Learning algorithm**.

**Step 1: We initialize the Q-Table**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Example-1.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>

So, for now, **our Q-Table is useless**; we need **to train our Q-function using the Q-Learning algorithm.**

Let's do it for 2 training timesteps:

Training timestep 1:

**Step 2: Choose action using Epsilon Greedy Strategy**

Because epsilon is big = 1.0, I take a random action, in this case, I go right.

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/q-ex-3.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>

**Step 3: Perform action At, gets Rt+1 and St+1**

By going right, I've got a small cheese, so \\(R_{t+1} = 1\\), and I'm in a new state.


<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/q-ex-4.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>

**Step 4: Update \\(Q(S_t, A_t)\\)**

We can now update \\(Q(S_t, A_t)\\) using our formula.

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/q-ex-5.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>
<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Example-4.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>

Training timestep 2:

**Step 2: Choose action using Epsilon Greedy Strategy**

**I take a random action again, since epsilon is big 0.99** (since we decay it a little bit because as the training progress, we want less and less exploration).

I took action down. **Not a good action since it leads me to the poison.**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/q-ex-6.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>

**Step 3: Perform action At, gets \\(R_{t+1}\\) and St+1**

Because I go to the poison state, **I get \\(R_{t+1} = -10\\), and I die.**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/q-ex-7.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
</figure>

**Step 4: Update \\(Q(S_t, A_t)\\)**

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/q-ex-8.jpg" alt="Maze-Example"/>
  </figure>
  
Because we're dead, we start a new episode. But what we see here is that **with two explorations steps, my agent became smarter.**

As we continue exploring and exploiting the environment and updating Q-values using TD target, **Q-Table will give us better and better approximations. And thus, at the end of the training, we'll get an estimate of the optimal Q-Function.**

---
Now that we **studied the theory of Q-Learning**, let's **implement it from scratch**. A Q-Learning agent that we will train in two environments:

1. *Frozen-Lake-v1* ❄️ (non-slippery version): where our agent will need to **go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G)** by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoiding holes (H).
2. *An autonomous taxi* 🚕 will need **to learn to navigate** a city to **transport its passengers from point A to point B.**

So you’ve heard all about the cool things that are happening in the machine learning world, and you want to join in. There’s just one problem – you don’t know how to code! 😱 Or maybe you’re a seasoned software engineer who wants to add some ML to your side-project, but you don’t have the time to pick up a whole new tech stack! For many people, the technical barriers to picking up machine learning feel insurmountable. That’s why Hugging Face created [AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain), and with the latest feature we’ve just added, we’re making “no-code” machine learning better than ever. Best of all, you can create your first project for ✨ free! ✨

[Hugging Face AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) lets you train models with **zero** configuration needed. Just choose your task (translation? how about question answering?), upload your data, and let Hugging Face do the rest of the work! By letting AutoTrain experiment with number of different models, there's even a good chance that you'll end up with a model that performs better than a model that's been hand-trained by an engineer 🤯 We’ve been expanding the number of tasks that we support, and we’re proud to announce that **you can now use AutoTrain for Computer Vision**! Image Classification is the latest task we’ve added, with more on the way. But what does this mean for you?

[Image Classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-classification) models learn to *categorize* images, meaning that you can train one of these models to label any image. Do you want a model that can recognize signatures? Distinguish bird species? Identify plant diseases? As long as you can find an appropriate dataset, an image classification model has you covered.

## How can you train your own image classifier?

If you haven’t [created a Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join) yet, now’s the time! Following that, make your way over to the [AutoTrain homepage](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) and click on “Create new project” to get started. You’ll be asked to fill in some basic info about your project. In the screenshot below you’ll see that I created a project named `butterflies-classification`, and I chose the “Image Classification” task. I’ve also chosen the “Automatic” model option, since I want to let AutoTrain do the work of finding the best model architectures for my project.

Once AutoTrain creates your project, you just need to connect your data. If you have the data locally, you can drag and drop the folder into the window. Since we can also use [any of the image classification datasets on the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets?task_categories=task_categories:image-classification), in this example I’ve decided to use the [NimaBoscarino/butterflies](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NimaBoscarino/butterflies) dataset. You can select separate training and validation datasets if available, or you can ask AutoTrain to split the data for you.

  </figure>
</div>

Once the data has been added, simply choose the number of model candidates that you’d like AutoModel to try out, review the expected training cost (training with 5 candidate models and less than 500 images is free 🤩), and start training!

In the screenshots above you can see that my project started 5 different models, which each reached different accuracy scores. One of them wasn’t performing very well at all, so AutoTrain went ahead and stopped it so that it wouldn’t waste resources. The very best model hit 84% accuracy, with effectively zero effort on my end 😍  To wrap it all up, you can visit your freshly trained models on the Hub and play around with them through the integrated [inference widget](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-widgets). For example, check out my butterfly classifier model over at [NimaBoscarino/butterflies](https://huggingface.co/NimaBoscarino/butterflies) 🦋

Document 2503: sing the Python debugger in a terminal. In this video, we'll learn how to use the Python debugger in a terminal. For this example, we are running code from the token classification section, downloading the Conll dataset before loading a tokenizer to preprocess it. Checkout the section of the course linked below for more information. Once this is done, we try to batch together some features of the training dataset by padding them and returning a tensor, then we get the following error. We use PyTorch here but you will get the same error with TensorFlow. As we have seen in the "How to debug an error?" video, the error message is at the end and it indicates we should use padding... which we are actually trying to do. So this is not useful and we will need to go a little deeper to debug the problem. Fortunately, you can use the Python debugger quite easily in a terminal by launching your script with python -m pdb instead of just python. When executing that command, you are sent to the first instruction of your script. You can run just the next instruction by typing n, or continue to the error by directly typing c. Once there, you go to the very bottom of the traceback, and you can type commands. The first two commands you should learn are u and d (for up and down), which allow you to go up in the Traceback or down. Going up twice, we get to the point the error was reached. The third command to learn is p, for print. It allows you to print any value you want. For instance here, we can see the value of return_tensors or batch_outputs to try to understand what triggered the error. The batch outputs dictionary is a bit hard to see, so let's dive into smaller pieces of it. Inside the debugger you can not only print any variable but also evaluate any expression, so we can look independently at the inputs or labels. Those labels are definitely weird: they are of various size, which we can actually confirm by printing the sizes. No wonder the tokenizer wasn't able to create a tensor with them! This is because the pad method only takes care of the tokenizer outputs: input IDs, attention mask and token type IDs, so we have to pad the labels ourselves before trying to create a tensor with them. Once you are ready to exit the Python debugger, you can press q for quit. Another way we can access the Python debugger is to set a "set_trace" instruction where we want in the script. It will interrupt the execution and launch the Python debugger at this place, and we can inspect all the variables before the next instruction is executed. Typing n executes the next instruction, which takes us back inside the traceback. One way to fix the error is to manually pad all labels to the longest, or we can use the data collator designed for this.
